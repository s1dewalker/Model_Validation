# Model Validation and Tuning

Steps involved in model validation and tuning (Regression example, on a continuos data)<br/>
<br/>

### 1. Get the data
### 2. Define the target (y) and features (X)
### 3. Split the data into training and testing set (validation if required)
### 4. Initiate a model, set parameters, and Fit the training set | `X_train, y_train`
### 5. Predict on `X_test`
### 6. Accuracy or Error metrics on `y_test` | Ex: Mean squared error, R squared
### 7. Bias-Variance tradeoff check | Balancing underfitting and overfitting
### 8. Iterate to tune the model (from step 4)
### 9. Cross Validation | if model not generalizing well
### 10. Selecting the best model w/ Hyperparameter tuning
